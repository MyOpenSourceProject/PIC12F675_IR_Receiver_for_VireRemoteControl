State Machine
=============
State machine is started here and it totally managed and keeps track of its 
states using the varible NEC_POS here are the details of NEC_POS (NEC position) varible 

if 
	NEC_POS == 1 :-		We just detected the first edge of the input singal, it may also mean (if
						interrupt is not false) that the 9ms leading pulse started after the first 
						edge THE next pulse is expected to arrive around 9ms so the TIMEOUT is set 
						to 11ms and PREPULSE is set to 8ms.
				
	NEC_POS == 2 :-		We just detected the second edge of the input signal and we finished the 9ms
						leading pulse and now 4.5ms space started after the second edge the next pulse 
						is expected to arrive around 4.5ms so TIMEOUT is set to 5.5ms and PREPULSE is 3ms.
		
	NEC_POS == 3 :-		We just detected the third edge of the input singal and we finished 4.5ms space 
						and addres lsb is now started after the third edge the next pulse is expected to 
						arrive around 562.5us so TIMEOUT is set to 2.3ms and PREPULSE is 0.2ms (timeout 
						can be much less at this state but to do this i have to add one more if else 
						statemetnt)
		
	NEC_POS == 4 :-		We just decected the fourth edge and the 562.5 us burt of LSB of address has ended now a 
						little space for '0'562.5us  or for '1' 1.6875ms  after the forth edge the next pulse
						is expected to arrive for '0' around 562.5us  and for '1' 1.675ms so TIMEOUT is set to 
						2.3ms and PREPULSE is 0.2ms
		
	NEC_POS == 5 to 66 :-  Data pulse keep comming TIMOUT and PREPLUSE remain same as above.		   
			
	NEC_POS == 67 :-    We just fined the command inverse MSB space not the final 562.5us burst has stated  so we
						fined the receiveing now we will check the address and command for being correct
